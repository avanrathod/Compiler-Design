# Compiler-Design
A compile that converts a C-type language to a simpler machine level code.

General Syntax:-

1)The program starts with { and ends with }.

2)The first set of statements are the declarations of the form "type id" where type are the primitive types or arrays and id is the identifier name.

3)After the declarations we have normal statements which can be assignments, if, while loop, do-while loop and break.
The parser used is recursive decent.
